# Fraud Detection X BNPP
## Description
We are a team of students working for BNPP on a use case. This use case involves developing a coorporate fraud detection model which aims to achieve the following:
 - High performance and accuracy
 - Explainable/Interpretable results

## Model Concept
The proposed model involves the use of different machine learning methods to achieve the requirements. Explanation on these methods can be found here: <not yet completed> 

## Structure
 - Dataset: Code for dataset simulation and creation mimicking coorporate transactional bank data
 - Exploration: Notebooks for model and conceptual exploration and validation
 - Model: Actual implemented model for usage
